##Face Recognition System

#Overview

This project is a real-time face recognition system built using deep learning and OpenCV. It captures images, preprocesses and augments them, organizes datasets, and trains a deep learning model for accurate face recognition.

#Features

Face Detection & Recognition: Uses OpenCV for real-time face detection.

Deep Learning Model: Trains on face embeddings for robust recognition.

Dataset Processing: Augments and organizes data for better training results.

Web Application Integration: Can be deployed in a web-based interface.

Live Camera Feed: Supports webcam-based real-time face recognition.

#Installation

Prerequisites

Python 3.x

OpenCV

TensorFlow/Keras

NumPy

Flask (for web integration)

Dlib (for face embedding extraction)

#Acknowledgments

This project utilizes OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, and Dlib for efficient face recognition.
